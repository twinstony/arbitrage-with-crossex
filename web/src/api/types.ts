/**
 * Hand-mirrored API contract for the Arbitrage with CrossEx backend
 * (Fastify on http://localhost:6688, proxied at /api).
 *
 * Monitoring route shapes mirror what the backend serializes from gate-api +
 * src/core/positions.ts. Trading types (ActionInput, deals) are copied
 * faithfully from src/core/actions.ts + src/core/errors.ts for the trading UI.
 *
 * Conventions:
 * - All Gate numerics are decimal STRINGS (qty, prices, balances, rates).
 * - Exposure groups are the one exception: they are computed server-side by
 *   core/positions.ts `computeExposure`, whose output uses plain NUMBERS.
 * - Margin rates are ratios (0..1); Gate returns a large sentinel (>= 9) when
 *   there are no positions — render "—" instead of a nonsensical percentage.
 * - createTime / create_time epoch units may be seconds OR milliseconds; use
 *   `toDate()` from lib/fmt.ts (value < 1e12 ⇒ seconds).
