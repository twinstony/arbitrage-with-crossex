/**
 * One 4-leg fixed-return position box, in seven descending tiers:
 *
 *   1-3  identity — asset · the two venues · maturity, in one line and three
 *        weights. The timeline below it is progress texture, not the place a
 *        maturity date is read.
 *   4    stats — FOUR main numbers: Fixed APY · PnL now · PnL at maturity ·
 *        Capital, with spread and ROI as captions under the APY. PnL now is
 *        AFTER costs: it is what the account reflects. Every figure that
 *        describes a FINISHED position is shown only on one — PnL now is the
 *        sole exception, being real cash and value whatever the book's shape.
 *   5    legs — collapsed rows carrying venue+kind+side as one identity, size
 *        in tokens and dollars, the locked rate, and Net. A row states its own
 *        problem (short / over by / unverified) rather than deferring to prose.
 *        Expanding gives live Entry/Mark/Lev, Close/Lev, and where the leg
 *        belongs.
 *   6-7  the waterfalls, and the cost assumptions behind them — the latter in a
 *        settings dialog, since they configure the numbers rather than report.
 *
 * LAYOUT RULE: transient UI (assignment, leverage, close, cost settings) opens
 * as a portaled overlay. Nothing may push the card's content sideways or down;
 * an inline panel that reflows the table hides the rows a user was reading.
 *
 * The card names four shapes — complete, mismatched, partial, orphan — because
 * "not fully hedged" covered three different situations with one sentence: a
 * book with legs missing, a book whose legs are all present but unevenly
 * sized, and a lone leg that is not a half-built strategy at all.
 *
 * Purely prop-driven — PositionsHome owns the queries.

          This used to be gated to Boros-less cards. The gate was about the

          is still exactly two whole venue legs, and closing it is still one
          coherent action — the user just had no way to ask for it, and had to
          find two hover-revealed row buttons instead. The Boros legs are
          deliberately NOT included: they close through a different venue with
          its own flow, so one button cannot honestly promise all four. */}
