/**
 * Which BOOK the per-position annotations belong to.
 *
 * A position on screen is half Boros (the tracked wallet) and half perp (the
 * connected Gate account), and both halves can be swapped independently. Every
 * annotation the user makes about a position — which legs belong to it, which
 * entry fills it is not charged for — is therefore only meaningful for one
 * (wallet, Gate account) PAIR, and has to be stored under both.
 *
 * Keyed by the wallet alone, a membership row naming `GATE_FUTURE_ETH_USDT`
 * silently applied to whatever the NEXT Gate account happened to hold under
 * that symbol. Keyed by neither — which is how excluded entry parts were
 * stored — `ETH#BINANCE-HYPERLIQUID#exec` is the same id for every account
 * running that pair, so one account's exclusions quietly reduced another's
 * cost basis.
 *
 * ⚠ Rotating the Gate API key for the SAME account reads as a new book and
 * resets these annotations. That is the deliberate direction to fail in: the
 * alternative is applying one account's statements to another's positions.
