 *
 * A pair is an ESTIMATE (the short side is sliced proportionally), so it always
 * mints `uc: 1` — the shared page must not present a proposed split as fact.
 *
 * ⚠ The displayed numbers are REQUIRED. `SharePayloadV1` types `a`, `p` and
 * `sp` as plain numbers, so a null reaching here can only become zero — and
 * zero is a public claim, not a blank. Non-nullable params push that decision
 * back to `canSharePair`, which hides the button instead. */
