/**
 * Boros two-leg market ticket: pick two markets, enter a size, see the
 * estimated and worst-case spread, confirm once. Both legs go out as market
 * orders.
 *
 * ⚠ ATOMIC ACCEPTANCE, NOT ATOMIC FILL. Both legs ride one on-chain batch, so
 * neither can be refused while the other trades. Each can still fill SHORT —
 * an IOC that matches part of its size succeeds rather than reverting — so the
 * panel's job is unchanged: the simulation shows what each leg can actually
 * fill at this size, and the post-trade report shows what each leg got plus
 * the residual left directional.
 *
 * Deliberate mirrors of the perp pair ticket (§1's consistency requirement):
 * the same size field position, the same slippage control shape, the same
 * order of readouts, the same hold-to-confirm. The two places they genuinely
 * cannot match are the Boros margin buckets (§6) and the collateral-unit
 * denomination of size — a Boros book is sized in its collateral token, not in
 * USD notional.
 *
 * Slippage is quoted in APR TICKS, not as a percentage of the rate. A Boros
 * book is priced in rate space with a 1bp tick, so "25 ticks" is a fixed
 * distance on the book; "0.25% of the rate" would be a different number of
 * ticks on a 3% book than on a 30% one, which is not what a tolerance means.
