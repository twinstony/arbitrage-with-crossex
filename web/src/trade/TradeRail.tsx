/**
 * The manual order ticket — now the CONTENT of an on-demand drawer rather
 * than a permanent right rail. The guided path is the StrategyWizard; this
 * surface is for free-form trades, and mounts only while its drawer is open,
 * so it can never sit armed beside content it has nothing to do with.
 *
 * The top-level choice is the VENUE, not the execution style:
 *
 *   CrossEx perps ──┬─ Pair   ─┬─ 2 market orders
 *                   │          └─ Limit + hedge
 *                   └─ Single
 *   Boros rates ────── Market order, 2 legs
 *
 * WHY venue-first. The Boros two-leg market ticket and the perp pair's "2
 * market orders" mode are near-identical surfaces — same verb, same two-leg
 * shape, same size and slippage controls — that put on DIFFERENT exposure on
 * DIFFERENT venues. Someone who takes the wrong one ends up unhedged while
 * believing they are hedged. As three sibling tabs those two sit adjacent and
 * a label is the only thing between them; nesting execution style UNDER the
 * venue means they can never be one mis-click apart, and the thing the user
 * has to hold in their head is reduced to "which venue" — which the rail then
 * states outright rather than leaving to be inferred.
 *
 * Everything downstream repeats the venue rather than assuming it: the ticket
 * header names it, and the Boros confirm names the venue and both markets
 * before anything is sent.
