/**
 * Guided open-a-strategy wizard: one modal, two steps, one full strategy.
 *
 *   Step 1 — lock the rate   (both Boros legs, one atomic batch)
 *   Step 2 — hedge the perps (both CrossEx legs)
 *   Done   — hand off to the Positions page
 *
 * The four legs were always opened as exactly these two executions; the wizard
 * exists to SAY so. Two side-by-side card buttons styled primary/secondary read
 * as "pick one" — the universal idiom for alternatives — when the truth is
 * "both, in this order". A numbered surface that advances is the only shape
 * that states an ordered conjunction.
 *
 * The tickets themselves are the SAME components the manual drawer mounts,
 * armed through the same TradeFlow prefill channel — the wizard owns sequence
 * and framing, never execution. Both stay mounted once seen (TradeRail's own
 * rule): step 1's fill report and a mid-flight execution must survive the step
 * switch, because a buried live directional exposure is precisely the failure
 * this surface exists to prevent.
 *
 * Progress is never trusted from memory alone: closing after step 1 is safe
 * because the Positions page derives "rate locked, unhedged" from live legs
 * (the asset card's missing-perp cue) and re-enters here at step 2.

 * be a second source of truth about money. It renders the BOOK (the fold of

 * book is clean, so the report shows no Complete/Retry, and `onDismiss` is
 * omitted because the report IS this step now.
 *
 * ⚠ Leg identity comes from the book's slots, never from any raw result: a
 * not-submitted leg's sentinel carries a HARDCODED direction (orders.ts), and
