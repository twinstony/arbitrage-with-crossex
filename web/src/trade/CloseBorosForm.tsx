/**
 * Closing Boros legs, quoted against the book.
 *
 * Boros has no close primitive and no reduce-only flag: a close is an opposing
 * market order sized to the position, sent after cancelling anything resting
 * (see borosPair.ts's cancel-and-close). Two things follow.
 *
 * **Size and rate bound are the caller's.** `BorosClosePositionRequest` says so
 * outright — "the caller computes them from the live netted position and shows
 * them". The server clamps the size to what is actually open, because a size
 * past the position would cross flat and open a fresh one the other way.
 *
 * **The quote comes from the pair simulator, not from the mark.** The mark rate
 * and the position's mark-to-market answer "what is this leg worth right now",
 * which is not the question a close asks. `/boros/pair/simulate` walks the real
 * book at the size being closed and returns the rate it would actually execute
 * at (`execApr`), the worst the bound allows (`worstApr`), and any depth
 * shortfall — so the form shows what the close will DO rather than what the
 * position currently IS.
 *
 * Each leg is its own request: the route takes one marketId, and a partial
 * failure must leave the other leg's outcome legible.
