#
# Arbitrage with CrossEx — macOS installer.
#
# Usage (paste into Terminal):
#   /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pendle-finance/arbitrage-with-crossex/main/install.sh)"
#
# What this script does — and everything it does:
#   1. Downloads a private copy of Node.js (official nodejs.org build, checksum
#      verified) into ~/.boros-crossex/ — it does NOT touch your system, PATH,
#      or shell profile, and never asks for an administrator password.
#   2. Downloads the app from GitHub into ~/.boros-crossex/app/.
#   3. Installs the app's dependencies and builds its web interface.
#   4. Registers a background service (a standard macOS "LaunchAgent") so the
#      app is always running for you, even after you restart your Mac.
#   5. Opens http://localhost:6688 in your browser and puts a launcher app in
#      ~/Applications. Your Gate.io API keys are entered later, in the browser —
#      never in this terminal.
#
# Re-running this command updates the app in place — it stops the previously
# running version first (including any orphaned/wedged copy), so an old version
# never lingers. Your keys and trade history (kept in ~/.boros-crossex/config and
# ~/.boros-crossex/data) are never touched.
# Uninstall: https://github.com/pendle-finance/arbitrage-with-crossex#uninstall
#
# This script is bash-3.2 compatible (macOS system bash).

# ⚠ NODE_ENV must not survive into this script.
#
# Yarn 1 reads NODE_ENV=production as `--production`: it skips devDependencies
# and still exits 0. `vite` and `typescript` are devDependencies, so the build
# step below would then have nothing to build with. The installer always needs
# a full dev install, whatever the caller's environment says.
#
# This bites two callers. The in-app update button spawns this script from the
# server, which the LaunchAgent runs with NODE_ENV=production; and anyone whose
# shell profile exports it hits the same wall by hand. The runtime value is set
# by the LaunchAgent, not here, so unsetting it changes nothing about the
# installed app.

# Only processes that are provably OUR server. `pgrep -f` alone is not enough:
# it matches any process whose ARGUMENTS contain that path, so an editor, a
# `tail -f` or a grep on the file would match — and these get SIGTERM then
# SIGKILL. It also MISSES a server started from inside $ROOT/app with relative
# arguments, which has no absolute path in its argv at all. So, mirroring what
# the Windows scripts do: use pgrep as a cheap prefilter, then confirm by the
# process's EXECUTABLE (lsof's `txt` fd is the ExecutablePath analogue, and
# lsof is already required for the port check), plus an inverse sweep over the
# private runtime's node binary that needs no command line whatsoever.
# NOTE: lsof reports FULLY RESOLVED paths, and both $ROOT/node (a symlink to
# the versioned dir) and $ROOT itself may be symlinked — so resolve first.
# NOTE: `-a` in the sweep is load-bearing: lsof ORs its selection criteria
# without it, which would match every process this user owns.
# NOTE: on macOS `pgrep -a` means "include ancestors", NOT "print argv" as on
# Linux — never use it here.
