## 1. How the strategy works

Perp traders pay (or earn) a floating funding rate. On [Boros](https://boros.pendle.finance), that funding rate is itself tradable - and the same coin's funding often carries **different implied fixed rates on different venues**: say ETH funding priced at 8% APR on Hyperliquid but 5% on Binance. The strategy locks in that gap.

One position is 4 legs, all at the same notional:

- **2 rate legs on Boros** - short the funding of the expensive market (you *receive* its fixed rate) and long the funding of the cheap one (you *pay* its fixed rate). Receive 8%, pay 5% → ~3% locked until the market's maturity.
- **2 perp legs via CrossEx** - a short perp on the first venue, a long perp on the second, both opened through [Gate CrossEx](https://www.gate.com/crossex) under one **unified margin** account. Each perp leg's funding cancels the floating funding its Boros leg owes, and the two perps cancel each other's price exposure - with the shared margin, one leg's gain collateralises the other's loss.

Once everything nets out there is no price exposure and no floating-rate exposure left - just the fixed spread, earned on the notional until maturity. The Opportunities scan prices that spread at your size, subtracts every cost it can model (Boros fees and price impact, perp fees and slippage, entry and exit), and shows what remains as a **net fixed APR on the capital** the four legs actually consume as margin.

Boros Academy walks through this strategy in more depth: [Fixed-Return Funding Arbitrage](https://docs.pendle.finance/boros-academy/advanced-strategies/fixed-return-funding-arbitrage).

**Fixed does not mean risk-free** - see section 4.

## 2. The recommended flow for using CrossEx Boros Terminal
You will use the tool for 3 things, in order:

### A. Discover and understand opportunities
A few things to note about the assumptions:
- Your current Gate VIP level is **already factored in**
- Other than that, its all about understanding the other assumptions:
![The assumptions bar above the Opportunities scan — notional, perp entry, perp exit cost and Boros entry](./Assumptions.png)
- For perp entry, **"Limit + hedge"** means the terminal will place a limit order on exchange A, wait for it to be filled, and immediately market order on the other exchange to hedge. This will save on perp fees (because *maker* fees is cheaper than *taker* fees)
- For perp exit cost, if you do not need to close the Perp positions (and be able to lock in another Boros spread in a subsequent 4-legged position), you can **Omit** it (instead of **Include**), which saves the perp fees.
- On Boros, **"At mark rate"** assumes you can enter the Boros legs without any price impact *(which could be unrealistic)*. **"Market at size"** assumes you do market orders on Boros for both legs. An optimised execution is to try to fill limit orders on one or two legs, to reduce price impact (and fees).

Other than that, the details are pretty self-explanatory. Try toggling the assumptions to see how it affects the PnL items.
![Opportunities details](./OpportunitiesDetails.png)

Note that you can click **"Execute it"** on an opportunity to pre-populate the forms for executing it.

### B. Execute a 4-legged Funding Rate Arbitrage position
It's recommended to **open the Boros legs first**, before opening the Perp legs. This is because the price impact from opening Boros position is higher and more uncertain, so you should "lock in" the Boros spread first before executing the whole 4-legged position.

Do **set your Boros address**, so that your Boros position can be tracked.

#### Executing the 2 perp legs


Executing with **"2 market orders"** is relatively straight forward.

As for executing the **"Limit + hedge"** default option, there are a few things to note:
1. The Limit (maker) side is auto chosen to minimise total fees
2. This is the default flow:
   - There is an **initial Maker price** (that is automatically set to be slightly beyond the best bid/best ask). You can also manually set this.
   - After you click **"Execute pair"**, a limit order is immediately placed at the initial maker price.
   - Whenever the limit order is filled (or partially filled), we automatically execute taker order (market order) to hedge the amount that were filled, repeat until the whole limit order is fully filled.
   - If the **countdown until convert** (default to 5 min) goes to zero and the trade is still not fully executed, the system will cancel the limit order and complete the pair through market orders. If you do not wish for this to happen, you can click **Stop** before the time runs out.
3. If the limit order is still not filled for some time (for example when you set a manual price that is far away), you can click **"Re-peg to touch"** to move the limit order close to the best bid/best ask. There is also an option to **Re-peg to a custom price**.
![Re-peg to touch](./RepegToTouch.png)

**Important:**
- You should try executing a **test amount first**, to get familiar with the flow, before executing a bigger amount
- When executing a large position, it's recommended to manually **break it into a few executions** (for example, do 5x 100k instead of 500k in one go)

### C. Monitor your position
Once opened, there's not much maintenance you need to do on a 4-legged position, except for when to close the two perp legs at maturity (if you don't roll over
into the next maturity).

What's most useful is to understand and breakdown the PnL for your positions.
![Current position](./CurrentPosition.png)

Each open position has two assumptions you can toggle, and both move the numbers *and* the waterfall charts:

**Perp exit cost** — what happens to the perp legs at maturity:
- **Include**. This is the default, and you need to incur another set of Perp trading fees. The chart uses the same fees and slippage as when you opened the perp legs.
- **Omit (rolling over)**: this means you don't need to pay perp fees for closing, which boosts your overall return. To do this, you need to be able to lock a decent spread on Boros, on the same perp pair, on a next maturity.

**Perp entry cost** — whether this position is charged what it cost to open the perp legs:
- **Include**. The default, and correct whenever you opened the perp legs for this position.
- **Omit (rolled over)**: use this when the perp legs were *already open* and you rolled them into this maturity. They paid their fees and crossed their spread during the previous position, but Gate reports a position's fees cumulatively and its entry price from the original open — so without this toggle, this position gets billed for money it never spent. Omitting moves the Current PnL as well as the projection.

Under **Include**, the **▾** button next to it itemises that cost so you can charge only *some* of it — useful when a book was built across several executions (a venue migration, a top-up, legs inherited from a previous maturity). Everything is ticked by default, the button shows how many parts are still charged (e.g. *Include (3 of 4)*), and your ticks are remembered per position. There are two kinds of row, and they are not equally precise:

- **Entry slip** rows are **per execution**, each with its date, the two venues crossed and the size matched. Untick the ones whose fills belonged to an earlier strategy.
- **Fees** rows are **per leg**, marked *position life*. Gate reports a position's trading fees as a single cumulative number and nothing records them per trade, so they genuinely cannot be split by date — the terminal shows them per leg rather than inventing a split. Note this also means a leg you have since migrated away from contributes nothing at all, since it is no longer an open position.

#### When one venue leg belongs to two positions

Run HL/OKX and HL/Binance at the same time and the HL side is **one** position everywhere you look: Gate reports a single row at a blended entry price, and Boros reports a single position at a blended fixed rate. Neither says which part is which strategy.

The terminal splits it back apart, and shows each position as its own box — its own size, its own entry prices, its own locked rate. It works from the execution record: the local deal journal, and your own fill history at the venue (each fill carries the order tag this terminal writes, so a fill can be matched back to the deal that made it). Where that record is complete, the split is a **measurement** — the chip on the box says *split measured*.

Where it isn't — positions opened elsewhere, or older than the fill history reaches — the terminal pairs the legs by how close their prices and open times are, and the box says *split unconfirmed*. Then:

- The sizes are still right: they come from the pairing itself, not from the prices.
- The **crossing cost is reported as unknown**, not estimated. The venue's blended entry price is an average across *both* strategies, so charging it to either one would invent a number.
- The **locked spread** falls back to the blended rate, which still nets out correctly across the two positions but is not exactly what either one locked.

**Adjust split** on the box is how you correct it. Type the size this position really holds and **Pin size**; the pinned size holds and everything unpinned is re-solved around it. **Detach** says these two legs are not a strategy together at all — both are then reported as unhedged. **Back to automatic** hands the pair back to the solver. Pins are remembered per tracked address.

If a venue position later shrinks below a pin, the pin is **clamped and reported** — never silently rescaled — and if a size ends up belonging to no position at all, it gets its own **unhedged** box rather than quietly disappearing.

#### What counts as your capital

Every APR on a position is a return *on capital*, so what goes into that number decides whether a position looks good. The perp side is always the initial margin those legs consume. For the Boros side there are two readings, and **Settings → Capital counted per position** picks one:

- **Posted balance** (default) — the collateral account's balance, split across the positions it backs. Right when that account exists for these positions and nothing else.
- **Margin used** — only the initial margin the Boros legs post. Use this if you also keep trading money in the same collateral account: otherwise that idle cash is counted as capital these positions needed, which inflates capital and drags every APR down.

The choice is remembered per browser and applies to every position box and the totals strip.

#### Rebalancing USDC and USDT

Your CrossEx account has two wallets. Every venue except Hyperliquid margins and settles in USDT. Hyperliquid settles in USDC, so it has its own USDC wallet, which starts at 0.

Opening a leg does not borrow. Its margin comes from your whole account. A wallet moves only when its legs pay or receive: hourly funding, fees, and profit or loss. When a wallet's legs lose more than it holds, the wallet goes negative and Gate lends you the coin: USDC for the Hyperliquid legs, USDT for the legs on every other venue. Gate counts the unrealised loss too, so a borrow can show while the cash is still positive.

The borrow costs two things. Gate holds 20% of it as initial margin and 10% as maintenance margin. Once the wallet is more than 10,000 short, Gate also charges interest every hour.

A hedged pair is delta-neutral, but not margin-neutral. Gate liquidates the account when the margin balance falls to the maintenance margin, and the maintenance margin grows with a move against the Hyperliquid leg: each leg's maintenance margin scales with its notional, and the losing leg drives its wallet negative, a borrow that adds 10% of itself to the maintenance margin. Each card on the Positions tab carries a chip like `Liquidates if ETH hits ~$3,150 (+37%)`: the price of the coin at which the account liquidates if only that coin moves and every other coin holds still. It turns amber inside 30% and red inside 15%. A pair that the model priced to a 10x pump and a 98% dump without finding a line reads `Safe through a 10x HYPE pump or 98% dump`. If Gate's margin figures are missing, the chip reads `No liquidation estimate` rather than claiming safety. The same nearest line sits in the hover of the IM and MM gauges in the header, and the rebalance quote carries a `Liquidation` fact with the line before and after the move, as a price and a move (`ETH ~$3,150 (+37%) → ~$3,290 (+43%)`).

The Balances tab shows a **Rebalance** section whenever either wallet has a borrow, Hyperliquid holds any USDC, or a job runs or is halted. An amber pill shows the borrow in the coin Gate lent. A row of six facts under it reads the same with and without a borrow, zeros included: what Gate lent you, the initial and maintenance margin it holds, the interest (`none under 10,000 USDC`, or the charge per day), the spare USDC on Hyperliquid, and the interest paid all time. All time means since 2025-01-01, the earliest date Gate's history serves. The total is kept on your machine and topped up with the new rows on each poll. Under the direction toggle one line says what the move does, and the quote is a second row of facts: the route and its wait, what is sent and what lands at which price, the cost, and, when the move repays a borrow, the borrow after, the margin it frees, the interest it saves, and the liquidation line before and after. The info mark next to the title opens a short card that says all this. The same amber pill sits in the header on every tab. Click it to open this section.

The section opens on the direction that repays the borrow. Keep the prefilled amount or type one, and hold the button:

- **USDT → Hyperliquid USDC** pays a USDC borrow back. The amount is capped at the borrow, at your free USDT, and at your available margin. When less than the borrow can move, an amber line says how much stays borrowed and why.
- **Hyperliquid USDC → USDT** pays a USDT borrow back, or brings spare USDC home when there is none. The amount is capped at the USDC you own there after open losses, so this move never starts a new borrow. With a USDT borrow the prefilled amount is the borrow, and you can type more, up to the spare.

Two routes exist and the terminal takes the cheaper one: a direct convert on Hyperliquid (instant, about 20 bps), or a spot loop through Gate (a spot trade plus two transfers; about 2.5 minutes toward USDC, about 6.5 minutes plus a flat $1 fee toward USDT). Under 1 USDC the hold is hidden.

A running job shows a progress bar, one segment per step with its seconds. A halted job shows the reason, the line `Funds are in <place>`, and a **Resume** and an **Abandon** button. After **Abandon**, move any USDC left in the Gate spot wallet by hand in Gate.

## 3. How to maximise return
These few factors move the needle the most in maximising your return on the 4-legged Funding Rate Arbitrage
1. Reduce perp fees with a **higher VIP tier** in Gate.
   * Play around with the VIP tier assumption in https://boros.pendle.finance/arbitrage-crossex, and you will see the immediate impact of your VIP tier on the potential returns.
   * As an example, my current VIP8 tier boosts a particular opportunity from **11.3% APR** to **16.2% APR**. For reference, I need a 400k capital in Gate to get VIP8 tier.
2. **Rolling over**
   * Being able to roll over an existing 4-legged position into the next maturity is a powerful boost to your return
   * The boost is two-fold: the existing position will escape the perp closing fees, and the new position will escape the perp opening fees. Just change the **Perp exit cost** assumption from **Include** to **Omit (rolling over)** to see the impact on the return (and on the next position, untick the inherited executions under **Perp entry cost**, since those legs already paid).
   * If you manage to keep rolling over, the subsequent 4-legged position wont have to pay **a single cent of perp fees** (for both entry and exit), which boosts the return even more.
3. Reduce perp fees + slipapge through an optimised execution of **Limit + hedge**
   * The goal is to minimise slipapge when executing the **Limit + hedge**. Its even possible to get possible slippage (for example, short Hyperliquid ETH at 1601, long OKX ETH at 1600)
   * Its best to execute when the market is generally more calm, reducing risks for big slippage
   * Its best to break a big trade (lets say 1M notional) into multiple rounds, to reduce the average slippage
   * To be the most careful, always **manually set the maker price** at a price relatively further away, and do the execution in the **Deal modal**. At the deal modal, its a *mini-game* of re-pegging the limit order price decently close to market, patiently wait for it to get hit (say by other impatient users on the perp), trying to get an optimised slippage.
4. Optimise **Boros spread**
   * To optimise for the spread you are locking, try to use **limit orders** to fill at least one Boros leg, and do a **market order** on the other leg. Sometimes, it can give you a much higher spread.
   * That said, sometimes when a decent opportunity are there that you can just market order, you could just take it (otherwise, some other users might take it before you)

## 4. Risk Disclosure
- **CEX risk** - your funds custody with Gate.
- **Cross-margin risk** - CrossEx manages margin across exchanges for you.
- **Spread risk** - rare, but the perp legs could diverge enough to trigger liquidation.
- **Boros liquidation risk** - a big enough move against your locked-in spread can break the hedge; keep a margin buffer.
- **Execution risk** - if a leg doesn't open hedged, check after execution.

Ultimately, you should **do your own research**, make sense of all the different risks and rewards, and make the decisions for yourself.
