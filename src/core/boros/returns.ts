/**
 * 4-leg strategy returns: join Boros funding-rate legs (by entered EVM address)
 * with the Gate CrossEx perp legs (connected account) and compute realized +
 * locked returns, net of all fees.
 *
 * The strategy (per boros-knowledge-base "fixed-return funding-rate arbitrage"):
 *   L1 perp SHORT on venue A  → receives A floating funding
 *   L2 perp LONG  on venue B  → pays     B floating funding   (delta-neutral)
 *   L3 Boros SHORT FR on A    → receives fixed rate_A, pays A floating
 *   L4 Boros LONG  FR on B    → pays     fixed rate_B, receives B floating
 * Floating cancels per venue → locked (rate_A − rate_B) APR on notional.
 *
 * Money conventions: every *Usd number is USD, positive = gain to the owner.
 * APRs are per-year decimal fractions. We SUM each leg's actual signed cash
 * flows (never "net out" the floating cancellation) so the totals reflect the
 * true near-cancellation plus any residual basis.
 *
 * Perp leg net = funding − trading fees (price MtM is EXCLUDED: on the
 * delta-neutral pair the two uPnLs cancel to entry-gap noise, which the
 * strategy already accounts as entry slippage — subtracted once at pair level
 * inside realizedPnlUsd). Funding is measured FROM THE STRATEGY CLOCK START:
 * when a perp position predates the clock (a pre-existing arb later locked on
 * Boros), the CrossEx account-book funding ledger re-bases it; Gate's
 * position-lifetime cumulative counter is only used when it equals the
 * since-start value (position opened at/after the clock) or as a warned
 * fallback when the ledger can't cover the window.

  /**
   * UNHEDGED SIZE, DERIVED — never merged from the places that produce it.
   *
   * A perp position is either on a card or it is unhedged, so the honest
   * definition is subtraction: what the venue reports, minus what the cards
   * show. Three sources used to be concatenated instead — the solver's
   * leftovers, the user's detachments, and a sweep for anything both missed —
   * which double-counted a leg that one branch reported AND another attached,
   * and still lost size when every branch skipped it.
   *
   * What comes out is a POSITION holding one leg, not a footnote. It used to
   * be a separate `unhedgedResiduals` list the client drew as an amber strip,
   * with an "attach to" picker and an undo button of its own — two controls
   * that restated what any leg row's own picker already says. A position is a
   * set of legs, and "one perp, nothing against it" is a set of legs; giving
   * it a card is what makes it answerable with the same control as everything
   * else, and shows its funding and fees, which the strip never did.
   *
   * ⚠ A POSITION IS AT MOST TWO PERP LEGS AND TWO BOROS LEGS — one of each per
   * venue, opposite sides. A coin with no Boros used to have ALL its perp legs
   * pooled onto one `BASE#perps` card, on the reasoning that a delta-neutral
   * pair waiting for its rate lock is one position. That reasoning only holds
   * while the coin has exactly one pair: a book with two longs against one
   * short is TWO strategies sharing a venue leg, and pooling them produced a
   * three-legged card whose header could only name two of its venues, whose
   * hedge ratios compared sums rather than pairs, and whose missing-Boros rows
   * sized themselves off one leg of a side they had summed.
   *
   * So the pairing comes from the same solver every Boros coin uses — the
   * tranche cards `splitStrategies` already builds — and only what NO tranche
   * could pair reaches here. What does is per-leg: a remainder is what one
   * strategy released, and remainders have nothing to do with each other.
   *
   * The one exception is `mergedStrategies`, the branch taken when the split
   * does NOT reconcile. There the solver has said it cannot explain the book,
   * so its cards stay merged and may hold any number of legs — splitting a
   * book you have just declared unsplittable would be a guess wearing the
   * clothes of a measurement. This whole pass is gated on `reconciled` for the
   * same reason.

 *
 * Evidence first, in the same order the perp side uses it:
 *  1. co-execution — the increments each leg decomposes into, bound by
 *     `bindExecutions`. This terminal places both Boros legs as ONE order, so
 *     a book it built is measured here rather than guessed;
 *  2. proximity — what is left, paired by size and open-time closeness, and
 *     reported `unconfirmed`.
 *
 * Whatever no pairing could claim comes back as `leftovers`: a directional leg
 * is a position of one leg, never a third leg on someone else's card.
