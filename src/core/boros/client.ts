/**
 * Read-only client for the public Boros backend. Every read goes to the

 * No auth, no secrets — everything is keyed by a public EVM address.
 *
 * Scaling conventions (verified against live responses, 2026-07):
 * - Raw sizes/balances/PnL are 18-decimal integer strings → divide by 1e18.
 *   The RESULT is denominated in the market's COLLATERAL token (tokenId), not
 *   USD: stable-margined books (tokenId 3) are ~USD; token-margined books
 *   (BTC/ETH/…) need × the collateral token's USD price (`assetMarkPrice` of a
 *   market on that same asset). Getting this wrong mis-scales by orders of
 *   magnitude — do all USD conversion through `resolveCollateralPricesUsd`.
 * - APR fields (fixedApr/markApr/floatingApr) are plain decimal fractions.
 * - Fee RATES in market config (settleFeeRate/takerFee) are 18-dec fractions.
 * - List endpoints wrap results as { results, total, skip } — never a bare array.

 * Gas the order pays for itself.

 * Boros funds its relayer from an off-chain USD budget per root, separate from
 * trading collateral, and an account with plenty of margin can still be unable
 * to send an order. The venue's own app never makes a user think about that,
 * and the mechanism is not a background job: a `payTreasury` call placed in the
 * SAME submission is counted as a credit by the relayer's pre-check
 * (`deltaFee = gas - marketEntranceFee - payTreasuryFee`, gas-tracking.service),
 * so a bundle carrying its own top-up is accepted even when the budget is at
 * zero or in debt. We do the same, so a low balance is never a dead end.
 *
 * These mirror the backend's ops-fee defaults (`minOpsFeeInUSD` 0.2,
 * `opsFeeToTakeInUSD` 1). They are app-settings values retuned upstream against
 * live gas prices and we do not read them — ours fire slightly earlier on
 * purpose, so an order tops up before it reaches the venue's own floor rather
 * than racing it. If Boros ever raises its floor above this, the venue's
 * refusal is still reported honestly as a gas failure.
 *
 * Here, not in borosApi, so the gate that warns and the client that tops up
