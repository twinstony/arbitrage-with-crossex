/**
 * Two-leg Boros market entry: eligibility, simulation, sizing arithmetic and
 * the confirm-time failsafes. Pure module — books, positions, margin buckets
 * and the clock are all injected, so nothing here fetches or reads time.
 *
 * The trade is a rate SPREAD across two Boros books that share a collateral
 * token and a maturity. One leg receives fixed, the other pays fixed:
 *
 *   direction 'short' → hit the BIDS  → RECEIVE fixed at exec_short
 *   direction 'long'  → lift the ASKS → PAY     fixed at exec_long
 *   spread = exec_short − exec_long − fees
 *
 * Sign discipline, because getting it wrong silently inverts every readout:
 * a HIGHER exec rate is better on the receive-fixed leg and WORSE on the
 * pay-fixed leg. Slippage therefore moves the two legs in opposite directions
 * on the number line but the SAME direction in the spread — the two tolerances
 * ADD. `worstSpreadApr = estSpreadApr − (slipShort + slipLong)`; quoting one
 * leg's worst case would understate the pair's by roughly half.
 *
 * Units: everything money-shaped in this module is in COLLATERAL-TOKEN units
 * (the unit a Boros margin bucket is actually denominated in, and the unit §6's
 * "you need X USDT in its account" has to be quoted in). USD is a display
 * conversion the caller applies with `collateralPriceUsd`. Since both legs of
 * an eligible pair share a tokenId, one collateral unit serves both.
 *
 * APRs are per-year decimal FRACTIONS everywhere, never percent. Slippage
 * tolerances are quoted in the same unit — an APR fraction, where one Boros
 * book tick is 0.0001 — never as a percentage OF the rate: the book is priced
 * in rate space, so a rate-relative tolerance would mean a different number of
 * ticks on a 3% book than on a 30% one.
