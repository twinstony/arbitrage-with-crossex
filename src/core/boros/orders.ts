/**
 * Boros order placement: the write seam, and the orchestration of a two-leg
 * market entry (§5).
 *
 * ⚠ ATOMIC ACCEPTANCE, NOT ATOMIC FILL. Both legs ride one `tryAggregate`
 * submitted with `requireSuccess` (see `./borosApi`), so neither can be
 * REJECTED while the other trades — the pair stands or falls together. That
 * removes the worst outcome, not every one: an IOC that matches only part of
 * its size SUCCEEDS rather than reverting, so the two legs can still fill to
 * different sizes and leave a residual directional.
 *
 * Everything in this module therefore still exists to make a shortfall
 * *legible* rather than to hide it: each leg reports what it actually got, the
 * realised spread is computed from the fills rather than the estimate, and the
 * residual that is left directional is returned as its own number.
 *
 * No execution semantics are invented here. Each leg is an ordinary market
 * order carrying the rate bound the user's slippage setting implies; matching,
 * partial fills and the on-chain rate-deviation guard are the venue's, exactly
 * as they would be for a lone market order. Nothing in this module ever widens
 * a tolerance or re-sends on its own — "complete now at market" is the user
 * re-issuing an order at a tolerance they choose, which arrives back here as a
 * fresh call.
 *
 * The two ways a leg can come up short need different responses from the user,
 * so they are never collapsed into one error: `insufficient-depth` means the
 * book ran out (the size was too big for the market), `rate-deviation` means
 * the chain refused the rate (the trade was priced too far from mark). See
 * `BorosLegFailureCode`.
