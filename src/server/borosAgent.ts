/**
 * Boros agent-key configuration, resolved once at boot.
 *
 * WHAT THIS KEY IS, AND IS NOT. Boros signs order placement with a DELEGATED
 * AGENT key that the root wallet approves on-chain once. Deposits, withdrawals
 * and cash transfers require the root wallet's own signature, and this install
 * never holds that. So the worst a leaked agent key can do is TRADE the account
 * — it cannot move a single token out. That is the whole reason this feature
 * can exist in a tool whose promise is that it never holds your funds, and it
 * is why no code path here ever accepts a root private key.
 *
 * Config lives in the same `.env` as the Gate credentials and inherits its 0600
 * hardening. Absent or malformed config is not an error — it leaves
 * `deps.borosOrders` undefined, which keeps the panel fully usable for pricing
 * and answers 503 on execute.
