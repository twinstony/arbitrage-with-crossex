<#
  Arbitrage with CrossEx - Windows installer.

  Usage (paste into PowerShell):
    irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pendle-finance/arbitrage-with-crossex/main/install.ps1 | iex

  What this script does - and everything it does:
    1. Downloads a private copy of Node.js (official nodejs.org build, checksum
       verified) into %LOCALAPPDATA%\CrossEx-Boros - it does NOT touch your
       system, your PATH, or any other program, and never needs Administrator.
    2. Downloads the app from GitHub into that same folder.
    3. Installs the app's dependencies and builds its web interface.
    4. Registers a background Scheduled Task so the app is always running for
       you, even after you restart Windows.
    5. Opens http://localhost:6688 in your browser and puts a shortcut in your
       Start Menu. Your Gate.io API keys are entered later, in the browser -
       never in this terminal.

  Re-running this command updates the app in place - it stops the previously
  running version first (including any orphaned/wedged copy), so an old version
  never lingers. Your keys and trade history are never touched.

  This is the Windows counterpart of install.sh; the two are kept in step.

#     compares the way the filesystem does. (-like is case-insensitive too, but
#     treats [ ] ? * in a path as wildcards, so it is deliberately avoided.)
#   - A server started with RELATIVE arguments from inside the app folder has no
#     absolute path in its command line at all. But node.exe under $Root\node\
#     cannot be running anything except this service, so any process whose
#     ExecutablePath sits there is ours no matter how it was launched - that

  # Machines that still delegate to classic conhost honour the late hide and were
  # never affected - which is why this reproduces on some boxes and not others.
